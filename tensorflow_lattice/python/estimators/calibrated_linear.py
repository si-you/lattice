  This model uses a piecewise linear calibration function on each of the
  real (as opposed to binary) inputs (parametrized) and then combines (sum up)
  the results. Optionally calibration can be made monotonic.

  It usually requires a preprocessing step on the data, to calculate the
  quantiles of each used feature. This can be done locally or in one worker
  only before training, in a separate invocation of your program (or directly).
  Typically this can be save (`save_dir` parameter) to the same
  directory where the data is.

  Hyper-parameters are given in the form of the object
  tfl_hparams.CalibrationHParams. It takes in per-feature calibration
  parameters.

  Internally values will be converted to tf.float32.

  Example:

  ```python
  def input_fn_train: ...
  def input_fn_eval: ...

  my_feature_columns=[...]

  # Have a separate program flag to generate the quantiles. Need to be run
  # only once.
  if FLAGS.create_quantiles:

      save_dir=FLAGS.data_dir,
      num_quantiles=1000,
      override=True)
    return  # Exit program.

  estimator = calibrated_linear.CalibratedLinearClassifier(
    feature_columns=feature_columns)
  estimator.train(input_fn=input_fn_train)
  estimator.evaluate(input_fn=input_fn_eval)
  estimator.predict(input_fn=input_fn_predict)
  ```

  Args:
    feature_columns: Optional, an iteratable containing all the feature
      columns used by the model. All items in the set should be instances of
      classes derived from `FeatureColumn`. If not given, the model will
      use as features the tensors returned by input_fn.
      Supported types of columns: RealValuedColumn.
    model_dir: Directory to save model parameters, graph and etc. This can
      also be used to load checkpoints from the directory into a estimator to
      continue training a previously saved model.
    quantiles_dir: location where quantiles for the data was saved. Typically
      the same directory as the training data. These quantiles can be
      generated only once with
      `pwl_calibration_layers.calculate_quantiles_for_keypoints` in a separate
      invocation of your program. If you don't want to use quantiles, you can
      set `keypoints_initializer` instead.
    keypoints_initializers_fn: if you know the distribution of your
      input features you can provide that directly instead of `quantiles_dir`.
      See `pwl_calibrators_layers.uniform_keypoints_for_signal`. It must be
      a closure that returns a pair of tensors with keypoints inputs and
      outputs to use for initialization (must match `num_keypoints` configured
      in `hparams`). Alternatively the closure can return a dict mapping
      feature name to pairs for initialization per feature. If `quantiles_dir`
      and `keypoints_initializers_fn` are set, the later takes precendence,
      and the features for which `keypoints_initializers` are not defined
      fallback to using the quantiles found in `quantiles_dir`. It uses a
      closure instead of the tensors themselves because the graph has to be
      created at the time the model is being build, which happens at a later
      time.
    optimizer: string, `Optimizer` object, or callable that defines the
      optimizer to use for training -- if a callable, it will be called with
      learning_rate=hparams.learning_rate.
    config: RunConfig object to configure the runtime settings. Typically set
      to learn_runner.EstimatorConfig().
    hparams: an instance of tfl_hparams.CalibrationHParams. If set to
      None default parameters are used.
    head: a `TensorFlow Estimator Head` which specifies how the loss function,
      final predictions, and so on are generated from model outputs. Defaults
      to using a sigmoid cross entropy head for binary classification and mean
      squared error head for regression.

  Returns:
    A `CalibratedLinearClassifier` estimator.

  Raises:
    ValueError: invalid parameters.
    KeyError: type of feature not supported.
